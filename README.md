## Overview

This is my current portfolio. I wanted to really challenge myself and use minimal CSS frameworks. In doing so I have expanded my horizons with styling and the capabilities with it. I did use Bootstrap for the Navbar and then Animate.style for their animations on my front page. I did this because of the time crunch of turning this assignment in but I will continue on make this page completely custom.

My overall idea of this page was to create a article-esque portfolio. Due to the assignment requirements I chopped this into 3 different pages but tried to keep the theme rolling nonetheless. That being said even though this portfolio is responsive and looks good in and sized viewport, its at its best in desktop view.

## Tech

- [ReactJS] - The base of this portfolio.
- [Bootstrap] - For quick styling (Navbar).
- [Animate.style] - For easy to use animations.
- [node.js] - Evented I/O for the backend.
- [Heroku] - For deployment.
